  description: One of your party member went crazy from the hunger. They're on the
    verge of a crazy murder spree.
  options:
  - Feed him. (-1 Human Flesh)
  - Kill him. (Remove %character% from the party)
  results:
  - They begin to bite into the meat like a madman, the bones crunching between their
    teeth. Their bloodshot gaze begins to calm, giving way to a deep sadness.
  - You did what you had to do. They had lost their humanity by now; nothing could
    put them back on the right path.
