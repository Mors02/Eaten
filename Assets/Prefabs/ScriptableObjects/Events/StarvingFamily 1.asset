  description: A man tells you to follow him, his family needs food urgently. You
    have a bad feeling
  options:
  - Go away
  - Follow him
  results:
  - You don't trust his erratic behaviour. The party leaves him alone, screaming
    for help.

    please feed them", he says. His distant gaze tells you he's gone. You retrieve
    several rocks from the rubble.
